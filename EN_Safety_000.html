        <h1>2. Safety</h1>
            <h2>Instructions</h1>
            <p>Observe the safety guidelines contained in the User manual, the national regulations 
            in force regarding injury prevention, as well as any regulations concerning work, operation 
            and safety. Changes to the machine are only permitted in agreement with the manufacturer. 
            Original spare parts and accessories authorised by the manufacturer ensure safety. The use 
            of other parts may invalidate liability for any possible consequences. Changes or modifications
            not explained in this User manual voids your authority to operate the machine. The manufacturer 
            shall not be held responsible for any damage caused due to incorrect installation of the machine 
            and/or the misunderstanding of this manual. The manufacturer reserves the right to make any 
            modification to this manual or the information contained herein at any time without notice. No 
            design data such as sample pictures provided in this manual may be modified or duplicated except 
            for the purpose of personal use. Check the machine regularly on faults.</p>
            <h2>Safety precautions</h2>
            <p>Components of the machine are exposed to high voltages and currents. Follow these instructions 
            carefully in order to reduce the risk of fire or electric shock. It is essential to uphold the 
            limits for voltage and current in all possible operating conditions and components. Electrical 
            diagrams, pneumatic diagrams and dimensional drawings are included in the section 'A. Annexes' 
            of this User manual. Adhere to the technical data and the specifications on connection conditions. 
            If permissible voltage values or current values are exceeded, the machine can be damaged. Read 
            the available documentation before installation and commissioning. Improper handling of the machine
            can cause harm to people or damage to property. The operator must therefore ensure that all 
            persons entrusted to work on the machine have read and understood the User manual and that the 
            safety notices in this User manual are observed. Work going beyond this may only be performed by 
            trained personnel or service technicians. Unauthorized interventions or modifications can 
            compromise operational safety. There are various warning stickers on the machine. They draw your 
            attention to dangers. Warning stickers must therefore not be removed, as then you and other people 
            cannot be aware of dangers and may be injured.</p>
            <h2>Qualification of operators</h2>
            <p>The staff responsible for the operation, maintenance, inspection and assembly must have a suitable 
            qualification level and must be informed having exhaustively studied the User manual. The areas of 
            responsibility, competence and supervision of personnel must be precisely regulated by the operator. 
            Where personnel do not have the correct level of knowledge, the operator must arrange for relevant 
            training to be provided. Only properly qualified personnel are permitted to perform such tasks as 
            transport, assembly, setup and maintenance. Qualified specialist staff are persons who are familiar 
            with the transport, installation, assembly, commissioning and operation of the machine and who bring 
            their relevant minimum qualifications to bear on their duties. The regulations in force, the local 
            laws and safety regulations must be observed. Pay attention to cleanliness and health.The machine is 
            intended for installation and use by qualified personnel familiar with health and safety requirements 
            and national legislation. Safety equipment, necessary for the prevention of accidents at the installation 
            and operating of the machine, must be provided in accordance with local regulations.</p>
            <h2>Intended use</h2>
            <p>The machine is designed for the { [applying of self-adhesive labels] }. Any other use is not intended. 
            The manufacturer is not liable for damage resulting from misuse. The machine complies with the current 
            safety related reference standards. Despite this, dangers to the user or third parties could arise, and 
            the machine or other property could be damaged when the machine is operating. The machine can be used only 
            if in perfect condition, in accordance with the reference standards in force and for the intended use. 
            Users must be aware of potential dangers and must comply with the operating instructions. Failures, in 
            particular those which affect safety, must be solved immediately. Intended use includes the observance of 
            the User manual and the reference documentation provided by the manufacturer.</p>
            <h2>Misuse</h2>
            <p>Safety of operation of the machine is only guaranteed by correct usage that complies with the provisions.
